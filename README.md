📚 Sigma 6.0 – DSA in Java (Practice Problems)










This repository contains my solutions and practice code for the Sigma 6.0 DSA Java course.
It covers a wide range of Data Structures & Algorithms topics, implemented in Java, along with problem-solving examples.

📌 About the Course

Sigma 6.0 is a comprehensive course that focuses on:

Core Java concepts

Data Structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.)

Algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, etc.)

Problem-solving using Java
