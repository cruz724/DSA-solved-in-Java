This repository contains my solutions and practice code for the **Sigma 6.0 DSA Java** course.  
It covers a wide range of **Data Structures & Algorithms** topics, implemented in **Java**, along with problem-solving examples.

---

## 📌 About the Course
**Sigma 6.0** is a comprehensive course that focuses on:
- Core Java concepts
- Data Structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.)
- Algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, etc.)
- Problem-solving using Java
